# juto:accounts-asana

An ES2015 Meteor OAuth handler package for Asana.  Based on the work by Rob Fallows' on his [imgur example](https://github.com/robfallows/tunguska-accounts-imgur) (and [his accompanying oauth package](https://github.com/robfallows/tunguska-imgur)).

This is a fully working OAuth login service, allowing you to use Asana as your Meteor authentication method. If you want to use it "as is" you can just `meteor add juto:accounts-asana` to your application.

See also the [complementary OAuth flow package](https://github.com/jutoapp/meteor-oauth-asana): `juto:oauth-asana`.

Enjoy :smile:
